# Apple Picker 3D – Unity Game

## Project Overview
**Apple Picker 3D** is a Unity-based game inspired by the classic Apple Picker tutorial from Bond (Ch. 29). Players control a basket to catch falling apples while avoiding hazardous objects (bombs/cinder blocks). The game includes multiple rounds, scoring, and a simple UI for round tracking and game restart.

This project was developed as part of **CS382 – Game Design, Development, and Technology (Project 1)**.  

### Key Features
- **4 Baskets** for catching apples  
- **Round system** with UI display (“Round 1” → “Round 4”)  
- **Apples** that increase score when caught  
- **Bombs / cinder blocks** that end the game if caught  
- **Start and Restart UI buttons**  
- **Simple 3D environment** with physics-based falling objects

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Launch the game in Unity or build as a standalone application.  
2. Move the basket horizontally with the mouse to catch apples.  
3. **Catch apples** to gain points (+100 per apple).  
4. **Avoid bombs**: catching a bomb ends the game immediately.  
5. The game progresses through 4 rounds. If all baskets are lost or a bomb is caught, the game ends.  
6. Press the **Restart button** to play again.
